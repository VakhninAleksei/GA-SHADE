# GA-SHADE
This is a source code of the proposed evolutionary-based algorithm, GA-SHADE, for simultaneously tuning hyper-parameters of an ML algorithm and the used set of features. As an example, Decision tree regression was taken to be optimized using GA-SHADE.

The folder with the results of the numerical experiments has been uploaded.
